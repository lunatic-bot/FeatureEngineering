# FeatureEngineering

This repository contains my learning notes and code from the **Feature Engineering** playlist by [Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/@KrishNaik). It includes practical implementations and examples that demonstrate various feature engineering techniques used in data preprocessing and machine learning.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Binning
- Feature extraction
- Feature selection techniques
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Domain-specific feature engineering

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
